This app will be divided in Workspaces.

The index workspace is the "Personal" workspace.

# "Personal" workspace

This "Personal" workspace will be a free space where a user can develop and test APIs. The APIs will be stored in the user's localStorage.

# Online workspaces

Online workspaces can be created. These workspaces can sync with Postly's server to store the APIs so the users can work from anywhere.

# A Workspace

A workspace is like a window that contains:

- users
- APIs
- Environment variables
- chat system
